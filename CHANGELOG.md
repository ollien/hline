## [0.2.1] - 2021-12-12
### Changed
  - Made `Error` enum non-exhaustive to promote future expansion.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-11-17
### Added
  - Added binary file detection. When a binary file is detected, `hline` will refuse to highlight it, unless passed the `-b` flag.

  - Fixed inconsistent error output
  - Fixed a panic when non-utf-8 data was encountered

## [0.1.1] - 2021-11-13
### Fixed

   `hline <pat> myfile.txt |head` would color your terminal red. Oops!
 - Made error message output a bit more human-friendly.

### Changed
 - Change highlight color to light red
